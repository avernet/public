"I agree: quantum randomness doesn't give us any freedom. I feel that it is even the opposite: it would be hard to be free if there was too much randomness. However, I don't understand the distinction you're making between "intrinsic randomness" and randomness over time". Would you care to elaborate?

I think you're onto something with your idea of "determinism shock". If I went through a DS, I can't remember it. It might indeed be the case that most people who now strongly argue "against free will" did go through a DS. Let's call them the determinism shock people" (DSP). However, I fail to understand what their pre-DS understanding is.

I think that my quest to get a definition of "free will" from DSP is part of that endeavor, and is not merely a discussion of semantics. The closest I have seen to such a definition is Miessler's well articulated Two-lever Argument. But I have a hard time believing that DSP once believed they could change the past or change the laws that govern the universe. Moreover, a world where we could change the past or the laws that govern the universe doesn't look to me like a place where we would be more free (unless of course you're the only one to have such an ability!). Instead, to me it sounds more like chaos, and even maybe not a place that can sustain life. Clearly, I am missing something. What is it?"

"We both agree that quantum randomness, just like necessity, doesn't give us any "freedom", right? So I fail to see how Koch can somehow be comforted by the fact that "pure determinism" would be false. Myself, I believe that we indeed live in a purely deterministic world and that quantum randomness is not intrinsic randomness, but randomness over time, which is the only empirically testable randomness anyway. But that's just the icing on the cake. :) Also, I'm not saying I'm currently "shocked" by the determinism of the world, just that I had a "Determinism Shock" (DS), probably when I was 17. Before that, I implicitly had the intuition that we had absolute/libertarian free will, which is the intuition I still think most people on earth have (which is natural without any knowledge of physics). Koch seemed to also have had a DS. You don't seem to have had a DS, which to me is interesting, because it might explain why we feel so differently about this matter, why I find this whole process of defining/re-defining "free will" (i.e. semantics) so boring/vain."
