"I agree: quantum randomness doesn't give us any freedom. I feel that it is even the opposite: it would be hard to be free if there was too much randomness. However, I don't understand the distinction you're making between "intrinsic randomness" and randomness over time". Would you care to elaborate?

I think you're onto something with your idea of "determinism shock". If I went through a DS, I can't remember it. It might indeed be the case that most people who now strongly argue "against free will" did go through a DS. Let's call them the determinism shock people" (DSP). However, I fail to understand what their pre-DS understanding is.

I think that my quest to get a definition of "free will" from DSP is part of that endeavor, and is not merely a discussion of semantics. The closest I have seen to such a definition is Miessler's well articulated Two-lever Argument. But I have a hard time believing that DSP once believed they could change the past or change the laws that govern the universe. Moreover, a world where we could change the past or the laws that govern the universe doesn't look to me like a place where we would be more free (unless of course you're the only one to have such an ability!). Instead, to me it sounds more like chaos, and even maybe not a place that can sustain life. Clearly, I am missing something. What is it?"
