introduction
“My name is Olivier Bruchez. There are at least four other persons in the French-speaking part of Switzerland who have the exact same name as me. So, if you think you know me, don't be so sure! I live and work in Lausanne, Switzerland, but I regularly go back to the Val de Bagnes, in the canton of Valais, where I grew up. I enjoy hiking in the Swiss Alps, as well as traveling around the world. Although I'm a vegetarian, since the age of nineteen, I appreciate good food (this might sound like a paradox to some), as well as fine wines and special beers. I'm an atheist, a skeptic, and a singularitarian, among other things. I've been interested in computer programming since the age of eleven. I'm also interested in productivity in general and Getting Things Done (GTD) in particular, which I've been implementing since 2007.”
