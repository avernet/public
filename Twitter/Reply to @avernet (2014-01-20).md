First, sorry for the delay.

To answer your question about "randomness over time": I definitely need to do more research. I lack better words/concepts to express this idea. But this is certainly nothing new. By "randomness over time", I just mean that I believe in hard/pure determinism, i.e. that when something happens at time t in our universe, nothing else could have happened. It happened by necessity. In other words, there are no uncaused / self-caused causes (causa sui). In an identical universe, the same thing would have happened at the same time t. What we call "randomness" when we observe a quantum system is random in the context of several measurements, done at different times. It doesn't make sense if you focus on only one particular time t. You have to make a measurement m1 at time t1, another measurement m2 at time t2, and so on. Of course, this is just a thought experiment, as "identical universe" probably doesn't really mean anything. Science can't really prove that "nothing else could have happened". We can't go back in time. And this position I have, as I understand it, is not really a [hidden variable theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_variable_theory). It probably has more to do with the [de Broglie–Bohm interpretation of quantum theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Broglie-Bohm_theory), but I'm not sure. So, this belief I hold is just that: a belief. It's elegant because it seems to me that it's easier to see our universe in terms of hard/pure determinism than not. But this is subjective.

Note that this has a clear link with the Could Have Done Otherwise (CHDO) concept, of course. More about this later.

Anyway, even if this belief is wrong, even if there are partially uncaused causes, pure/intrinsic randomness, it doesn't give us more freedom. I think we both agree about this particular point. Hard/pure determinism is just the cherry on the cake.

About the "determinism shock people" (DSP): I can only speak for myself. First of all, this is a strange concept. I'm a bit surprised that people are not talking about it more in free will discussions (or maybe I haven't paid enough attention). For me, the only reason I'm so "obsessed" with free will is because I went through a DS. Koch is the first person I've read to clearly mention it. But then he seems to be reassured by quantum indeterminacy and I'm not, so we have slightly different positions.

Clearly, I had no pre-DS understanding. I was an agnostic, if you prefer. Just like a baby is an agnostic about god, until he unconsciously accepts the mainstream/standard position, probably his parents', or consciously think about it and decides to be an explicit agnostic, a theist, or an atheist. Believe me: I've never thought I could change the past or the laws of physics. I think that's what you are missing. It's just that I had never thought about it. Before that, well, I was just "feeling" things, like a child. I was not thinking about them. And it was really hard to accept that my consciousness is an emergent property of my brain, that I am just the atoms in my brain. It doesn't feel that way. Our brains have not evolved to see reality in a reductionist way.

By the way, I like this parallel between god/soul/afterlife and (libertarian) free will, because, really, it's the same thing. Most people don't really think about it. Stop me if I'm wrong but I don't think I'm being condescending here. Most people are scientifically and philosophically illiterate. That's the way it is. People have other interests. Science and philosophy are hard.

That's why experimental philosophy is interesting. What Nahmias does (or at least tries to do) is useful, in principle. He's trying to make explicit something that is fundamentally implicit. But I find his papers also frustrating. Ask people about their religious beliefs and you'll naturally get conflictual ideas, answers that don't really make sense (from an empirical/scientific point of view). So you need to be really clear about what you ask, how you ask it, and what you conclude from the answers you get. And what I've read so far (mainly from Nahmias, I need to read other papers) doesn't seem very convincing to me.

"I agree: quantum randomness doesn't give us any freedom. I feel that it is even the opposite: it would be hard to be free if there was too much randomness. However, I don't understand the distinction you're making between "intrinsic randomness" and randomness over time". Would you care to elaborate?

I think you're onto something with your idea of "determinism shock". If I went through a DS, I can't remember it. It might indeed be the case that most people who now strongly argue "against free will" did go through a DS. Let's call them the determinism shock people" (DSP). However, I fail to understand what their pre-DS understanding is.

I think that my quest to get a definition of "free will" from DSP is part of that endeavor, and is not merely a discussion of semantics. The closest I have seen to such a definition is Miessler's well articulated Two-lever Argument. But I have a hard time believing that DSP once believed they could change the past or change the laws that govern the universe. Moreover, a world where we could change the past or the laws that govern the universe doesn't look to me like a place where we would be more free (unless of course you're the only one to have such an ability!). Instead, to me it sounds more like chaos, and even maybe not a place that can sustain life. Clearly, I am missing something. What is it?"

"We both agree that quantum randomness, just like necessity, doesn't give us any "freedom", right? So I fail to see how Koch can somehow be comforted by the fact that "pure determinism" would be false. Myself, I believe that we indeed live in a purely deterministic world and that quantum randomness is not intrinsic randomness, but randomness over time, which is the only empirically testable randomness anyway. But that's just the icing on the cake. :) Also, I'm not saying I'm currently "shocked" by the determinism of the world, just that I had a "Determinism Shock" (DS), probably when I was 17. Before that, I implicitly had the intuition that we had absolute/libertarian free will, which is the intuition I still think most people on earth have (which is natural without any knowledge of physics). Koch seemed to also have had a DS. You don't seem to have had a DS, which to me is interesting, because it might explain why we feel so differently about this matter, why I find this whole process of defining/re-defining "free will" (i.e. semantics) so boring/vain."

"I do believe that what happens is either A necessary or B can be influenced by quantum randomness. A is pure determinism, and B adds uncaused quantum randomness, a randomness which cannot be influenced or predicted. In the last couple of years I switch to thinking that B, instead of A, better corresponds to reality. Q: What would have happened if everything was exactly the same? A: What happened ± some randomness add to the mix. I don't think I ever considered that question as a kid. And I don't remember ever finding the answer shocking or "abhorrent", as Koch said. Instead I find the question uninteresting. We're really interested in either what happened (facts/history) or what would have happened if something had been different. Am I missing something? What are you finding so shocking in that answer? Why is it even worth pondering?"

"Exactly. However discussing semantics is only interesting to a point. What about the ontology of free will and determinism? Do we at least agree about the fact that when something happens at time t anywhere in the universe, it is necessary and nothing else could have happened? If so, has it always been obvious to you (including when you were a child)? If not, was it a shock when you realized that it applied to your brain as well? Do you even remember when you realized it?"

1) "Yes, words are ambiguous. But giving common words a completely different meaning is IMHO bad philosophy."<br>
2) "Or define it better and come up with words that better reflect that definition (e.g. "hard free will" and "practical free will")."

"1) Languages/words are ambiguous. We should accept that fact and move on. Choosing one definition over another is pointless. 2) Isn't the fact that free will has been debated for thousands of years a clue that we should stop using it as a concept?"

"Isn't that what compatibilists do? :) I'm only half joking, of course. Are you really "free" if anybody can add "yes but" to what you say? Is "free" even useful without a context? Without a "framework"? Is "free will" *useful* as two words without a context?"

"Yes, it's most semantics. But semantics matter, especially in philosophy, as bad semantics often leads to incorrect conclusions. Eg. hard determinists feel compelled to redefine what "freedom" means, and consequently also need redefine "choice", "decision", …"

"Just read (again?) what Daniel Miessler has to say about absolute and practical free will. At this point I think the issue of free will has a lot more to do with semantics than I previously thought. But, yes, as I must admit I still don't understand your point of view, maybe another blog post would be helpful. :)"
