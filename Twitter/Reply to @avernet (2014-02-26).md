"No necessarily, in particular if you think quantum indeterminism has no bearing on the discussion."

"Laplace's determinism is incompatible with quantum mechanics, among other things (see http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/laplaces_demon.html). So making people think about an old and incorrect notion of determinism is a little weird."

"Why? How is it so different?"

1a) "Ok. Then I still don't know. "My" determinism is certainly not Laplace's "naive" determinism, so we already have a problem here."

1a) "I was more thinking along the lines of "how can you test whether someone understands X", where X might be determinism."
1b) "The goal of the study isn't to change peoples' mind or teach them something, but to better understand how they think."
2) "If by "cannot" you mean "did not" and "will not", isn't that the case of any thought experiment? (The brain is pretty good at it.)"

1) "I don't know! How do you make someone really think about something he doesn't really understand?"
2) "I'm already puzzled by case 1 (Laplace's demon / supercomputer). We're asked to think about something that cannot exist."

"Are they? How would you frame a question so it would be a better "test"?"

"Also, I think the questions in the study are pretty weak and ambiguous, so I don't know what to make of the answers."

"Anyway, I completely agree with Jerry Coyne: people don't  seem to really understand determinism, physics, etc."

"And I read "this" instead of "his" in your tweet! :)"

"I only noticed after reading a couple of paragraphs, and thinking "wowâ€“this is surprisingly well written and argued"! :)"

"It's good analysis of Nahmias' study. Also see his comment, which is very much inline with my thinking: http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2014/02/21/another-paper-on-folk-intuitions-about-free-will-nahmias-et-al/#comment-730026"
