"Determinism" is a bit like "free will". There's the general definition. And then there are [many variations and interpretations of the basic concept](http://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/determinisms/). In particular, there exists something called [pre-determinism](http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/pre-determinism.html) and also [adequate determinism](http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/adequate_determinism.html).

If somebody asks me if I believe in free will, I usually assume that he's talking about libertarian free will (because I believe that's what most people believe in), so the answer will be "no". If I'm asked if I believe in compatibilist free will, then the answer will be "yes, but I don't see the point in using that word in that sense".

Same for determinism. Do I believe that anything or anybody 14 billion years ago knew what would happen today? No. Or that there was "implicit information" about what would happen today? Not really. Or that a supercomputer could predict the future? Not at all.

So I think you'd agree that we should be very careful when asking people questions related to these concepts. You can't allow yourself to be vague or the answers will be unusable.

I disagree that "quantum indeterminism has no bearing on the discussion". It has indirect bearing on the discussion, because quantum indeterminism is explicitly rejected in one of Nahmias' thought experiments, the one with the supercomputer. It's not that this supercomputer cannot exist because it hasn't existed yet and nobody will build it for some practical reasons (such as cost). It cannot exist because it would violate the laws of physics as we know them. You're right to say that our brain can imagine pretty much anything, including things that are incompatible with the laws of physics (I can imagine myself flying, being invisible, or immortal - as an immaterial soul). But I think to be really useful, a thought experiment must present a situation that is compatible with the laws of physics. Your [pain/prize thought experiment](https://twitter.com/avernet/status/433499672615735296) or the [trolley problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem) are such thought experiments.

"No necessarily, in particular if you think quantum indeterminism has no bearing on the discussion."

"Laplace's determinism is incompatible with quantum mechanics, among other things (see http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/laplaces_demon.html). So making people think about an old and incorrect notion of determinism is a little weird."

"Why? How is it so different?"

1a) "Ok. Then I still don't know. "My" determinism is certainly not Laplace's "naive" determinism, so we already have a problem here."

1a) "I was more thinking along the lines of "how can you test whether someone understands X", where X might be determinism."<br>
1b) "The goal of the study isn't to change peoples' mind or teach them something, but to better understand how they think."<br>
2) "If by "cannot" you mean "did not" and "will not", isn't that the case of any thought experiment? (The brain is pretty good at it.)"<br>

1) "I don't know! How do you make someone really think about something he doesn't really understand?"<br>
2) "I'm already puzzled by case 1 (Laplace's demon / supercomputer). We're asked to think about something that cannot exist."<br>

"Are they? How would you frame a question so it would be a better "test"?"

"Also, I think the questions in the study are pretty weak and ambiguous, so I don't know what to make of the answers."

"Anyway, I completely agree with Jerry Coyne: people don't  seem to really understand determinism, physics, etc."

"It's good analysis of Nahmias' study. Also see his comment, which is very much inline with my thinking: http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2014/02/21/another-paper-on-folk-intuitions-about-free-will-nahmias-et-al/#comment-730026"
