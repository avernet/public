"Re. "Ignorance doesnâ€™t imply nonexistence", I tried to write as clearly as I could, but apparently failed to get my point across. So, let's take a step back. I was still trying to understand what the "illusion" is in Harris' piece. http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/the-marionettes-lament I read him argue that free will, as "understood" by ordinary people, is an illusion. However he struggles to define what the illusion is. I think you found why: ordinary people are truly agnostic about free will. Their position on free will is comparable to small children's take on God. (Which can be contrasted to adult's position on God.) That is: they are just ignorant. That makes it hard to point to anything wrong, because there is nothing to point to. Because ignorance cannot imply existence or nonexistence, discussing free will as understood by ordinary people is sterile. There is just not enough material there for us to find something that would qualify as an illusion. Harris set himself up for failure; one can't prove or disprove ordinary people's take on free will. We can only discuss educated takes of free will, such as Robert Kane's libertarianism or Dennett's compatibilism."
